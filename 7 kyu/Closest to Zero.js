//Simply find the closest value to zero from the list. Notice that there are negatives in the list.

//List is always not empty and contains only integers. Return None if it is not possible to define only one of such values. And of course, we are expecting 0 as closest value to zero.

//Examples:

//[2, 4, -1, -3]  => -1
//[5, 2, -2]      => None
//[5, 2, 2]       => 2
//[13, 0, -6]     => 0
